## PMP questions that will make you cry
What is the difference between the Monitor and Control Project Work process and the Direct and Manage Project Work process?

What is the difference between risk regirster and risk report?

You have recently been assigned as the manager of a project after the previous manager quit the company. From the first meetings with the project team you discover that the morale of the team is very low. You speak to some of the team members in private and you feel that they were not given opportunities to participate in team development activities and that they did not have opportunities to grow. Which of the following is a primary factor for this situation?

A. Use of zero-sum rewards in the project
B. A poorly defined resource calendar
C. Too many hierarchical levels in the project organization chart
D. Poor communication planning

And the answer being B, while reasons being According to the PMBOK® Guide (6th Edition), resource calendars identify times when the project team members can participate in team development activities. If the team members are unable to find time for such activities, it is likely that the calendar has been poorly planned out.

But in reality I feel like all the above options could be the correct answer. For A, it is 

My humble opinion for future PMP structure: an oral exam hosted by a panel of experienced project managers enlisted at random (like a volunteer service of the PMP holder) and while interview, decide whether the candidate can follow the though process and reasoning skills in handling managerial situation, and as long as they can explain themselves and follow the general guideline, they should be given a pass. Makes much more sense than forcing one correct answer. Frankly, this ia terrible idea, as it limits creativity and flexibility that are essential to management success.

Or divide the assessment into two parts:
1. the hard skills part, such as ability to interpret an SPI of 0.8, using NPV to decide on which project to invest in
2. The people soft skill/political part, such as the ability to decide when to force/smooth/faciliate collaboration part - and have this part down through interview with experience certificate holder

## When you learn nothing new from most of the readings...
A target project schedule model may also be developed with a defined target start and target finish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented in summary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. --------PMBOK 6e

...ummm I mean, it's called a schedule, what else would you expect?

Schedule Forecasts:The information is based on the project’s past performance
and expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions.

...I mean it's a forcast...

## How to talk like a PM and annoys everybody
"Our CPFF and CPIF contracts may not allow timely assessment with CPI and TCPI, and we risk goving over our BAC...but of course we could continue to modify our process through quarterly RCAs or switch to a DfX model"
- Just some other acronyms you could through in the mix to create an intimidating conversation: CPFF, CPPC, CPIF, FP, LS, FPF, FPIF, SOW, NDA, IFB, RFQ, RFR, PO, RFI.
...at first my responses was OMG FML, but then I googled and I was like =_= WTH LOL.
