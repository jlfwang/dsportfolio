I remember when I was little, I would hear from my mom all these tricks that she used to make herself fall asleep and I never understood why being able to sleep through the night was such a big deal until I myself started having my own episodes of insomnia, which I guess is an unfortunate sign of becoming a grown-up.

At some point, sleep became something I needed to plan for, and I was concerned with its quality and duration, as I noticed how they affect my functioning during the daytime. I started reading online about different techniques in hopes of improving my sleep quality, but it is hard to piece together a complete picture of exactly how our brain is wired to induce sleep and the fundamental mechanism of how sleep is related to our overall health when you are just reading bits and pieces from random unverified sources.

And then I stumbled across Why We Sleep by Dr. Matthew Walker. It was recommended by Bill Gates as his favorite book of 2019. The writing referred to a wide range of peer-reviewed articles, which certainly distinguished it from the unverified internet articles, and I was also surprised to find out that Dr. Walker teaches at UC Berkeley (how did I not take any of his classes and he has a 4.7/ 5 on Rate My Professors, at Berkeley lol)! In any case, the book was a pleasant read as it perfectly blends together the expounding of scientific research and anecdotal evidence, which made the information both relatable and easy to digest. 

The book begins with a section that helps the readers understand the fundamental importance of sleep to both mental and physical health, which, I believe, couldn’t be emphasized enough in a society and culture that eulogize the act of seizing every second to be productive. The rest of the book went on to talk about how different environmental factors play their part in affecting our sleep. My favorite chapter is Chapter 10 “Dreaming as Overnight Therapy” where it talks about the role of REM and NREM sleep in determining what we end up keeping in our memory and with what valence and sentiment we keep these memories. If you don’t have time for the whole book, at least read this one chapter and here is a quote from the chapter that helped me tremendously in healing from a heartbreak: “It was not, therefore, time per se that healed all wounds, but instead it was time spent in dream sleep that was providing emotional convalescence. To sleep, perchance to heal.”
